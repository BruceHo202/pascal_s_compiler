```
This program generates analysing table, and analyse Fstdout.txt which generated by 
program updateMarkTable, in which source code is transformed into standard form of 
language. After this procedure, save the table into binary file table.dat, so that 
operatings of this program afterwards does not need to generate analysing table again.
Afterwards analyse input file Fstdout.txt according to analysing table. Generate a node
of grammar analysing tree during forwarding operating, give nodes parent-children relation
in the process of reducing, by parenting reduce-to node and childrening reduced nodes. 
During reducing process, do semantic analysing. Give nodes type and judge whether the
type is appropriate. Types of every node is a tree structure, aiming to express types of 
record of array or function, etc. During this process, also fill attributes of marktable.
After analysing source code, generate p-code. P-CODE in this program is adjusted by requirments
of this program, in order to accomplish both call by reference and call by value. Traverse the 
grammar analysing tree by depth first, when visiting program_body node, traverse this subtree
rooted by program_body and genarates p-code from bottom up.
